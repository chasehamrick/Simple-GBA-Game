OBJECTIVE

My simple GBA game is a very simple space shooter. I added a few stationary stars in the background as well as some moving stars that loop for the added
effect of being in space. The objective of the game is to dodge all the suicide enemies/ meteors that fall from the top of the screen, and if you cannot dodge them, 
then you shoot them to destroy them, however, you only have 10 bullets, so you have to make sure you conserve them and only use them when absolutetly necessary.
The game ends when you are hit by one of the falling red squares, if you are hit, the game just automatically resets / initializes / starts over.


CONTROLS

Press z to exit splash screen, in game use left and right arrows to move, and x to shoot your 10 bullets one at a time, press enter at any time to pause
Press enter to fire a projectile bullet and eliminate any red squares that the bullets hit (they do not disappear after 1 enemy)
